#Iron Tower

#Description

Iron Tower will be a web-based where the user builds a tower, floor by floor. Each floor once built can be either businesses (restaurants, shopping outlets, etc) or apartments. Apartments allow for certain numbers of residents which have to be available to work at businesses.

You may theme this game as you like and can vary the balancing (residents allowed in aparemnts, time to payout, etc).
